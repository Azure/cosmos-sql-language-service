Use of language service package : 
- Define antlr grammar for your language. Generate parser and lexer using antlr command. And define the keywords dictionary. Key of item in dictionary is keyword defined in Lexer.g4 and value is the word that used as expected token shown.
- Initialize LanguageService in package with parser, lexer, and keywords dictionary. Parser and lexer are generated by grammar file and keywords dictionary is defined by language service users.
- Use getCompletionWords method of LanguageService to get expected keyword for current input script.
- Use getSyntaxErrors method of LanguageService to get syntax errors for current input script.
